# Code of Conduct

## Our Community

We ask that our community and users of this repo conduct themselves in a
respectful, professional, open, and considerate manner. We recognise
that by having an open community such as this, we are more able to
foster continued growth and generate new ideas as a result of each
contributor's personal experience and diverse backgrounds.

We are aiming to create a safe environment where users can freely
contribute their ideas and receive feedback. We wish to provide a space
where people can come to further their learning and assist others in
their data science journey.

Examples of encouraged behaviours:

-   Respecting other peoples' opinion
-   Being open to feedback and using it as a learning opportunity
-   Asking and offering help
-   Being inclusive and welcoming so as not to offend peoples' religion,
    sexual orientation, gender, political view, etc.
-   Working collaboratively with peers

Examples of discouraged behaviours:

-   Insulting or derogatory comments
-   Excessive swearing
-   Publishing personal private information without consent
-   Unwelcome sexualised language or imagery
-   Violent threats

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may
be reported by contacting the project team. The project team will review

Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted
separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in
good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined
by other members of the project.
