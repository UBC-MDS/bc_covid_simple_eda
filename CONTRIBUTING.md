## Contributing

This document outlines how to propose changes to the BC Covid Simple EDA
project. Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!

## Types of Contributions

There are many ways to contribute to the project. Submitting bug
reports, fixing bugs, implementing new features or simply submitting any
types of feedback about the project are welcome.

## How to Contribute

1.  You can report problems or suggest improvements by creating a Github
    Issue. This allows us to assign the item to someone and to respond
    to it in a threaded discussion. If you are reporting a bug, please
    include:

-   Your operating system name and version.

-   Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in
    troubleshooting.

-   Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

2.  If you would like to resolve an existing issue that's been labeled
    as "bug" and "help wanted", you can submit a pull request (PR).
    Guidelines for submitting a PR are included below. We will adapt the
    Github workflow and reference can be found
    [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow#introduction).

3.  If you'd like to suggest substantial changes such as removing or
    adding features, please first raise an issue to allow the project
    team to comment, so we can discuss whether how these changes should
    be made. Please note:

-   Explain in detail how it would work.
-   Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to
    implement.

## Pull Request Guidelines

-   Before submitting a pull request, please propose the change in the
    "Issues" section for other contributors to assess whether or not a
    change is required. If a bug is found, create an issue and describe
    the bug with a minimal reproducible example.

-   We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request
    (PR).

-   The pull request should include additional tests if appropriate.

-   If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.

-   The pull request should work for all currently supported operating
    systems and versions of Python.

-   All new code should follow the tidyverse [style
    guide](http://style.tidyverse.org) or PEP8 [style
    guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

-   Include a summary of the changes and what problem it solves. This
    helps the PR reviewer to feedback on your changes.
